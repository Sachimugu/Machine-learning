# Project Details

This repo contain machine learning projects

## Multiple Linear Regression Model
Using Multiple Linear Regression model to predict the consumption of fuel by a car.

The data set was downloaded from this website :- https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html

This project was done to implement my learnings about the machine learning algorithms.

## Logistic Regression

In statistics, the Logistic Regression model is a widely used statistical model which is primarily used for classification purposes. It means that given a set of observations, Logistic Regression algorithm helps us to classify these observations into two or more discrete classes. So, the target variable is discrete in nature.

**Problem Statement**
In this project, I try to answer the question that whether or not an employee will quit a his/her job. I implement Logistic Regression with Python and Scikit-Learn.

To answer the question, I build a classifier to predict whether or not an employee will quit a his/her job by training a binary classification model using Logistic Regression. I have used the Rain in Australia dataset downloaded from the Kaggle website for this project.

The Python implementation is presented in the Jupyter notebook

**Result**

The logistic regression model accuracy score is  0.84 and 10-fold cross validation average accuracy: 0.837. So, the model does a very good job in predicting whether or not  an employee will quit a his/her job  The model shows no signs of overfitting.
